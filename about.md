# Course Overview

CS 6150 is a project centered course where teams of students embark on a semester-long exploration of their chosen topics. Early in the semester, each student selects a project aligned with the course objectives, and over the coming weeks, they work collaboratively to develop and implement a solution. The ultimate goal is to deploy these solutions by the end of the semester, contributing to the course's ethos of real-world impact through applied computing.

For additional information on the Computing for Good initiative, we invite you to explore [http://c4g.gatech.edu](http://c4g.gatech.edu). This initiative represents our commitment to using computing as a force for positive change, aligning with the broader movement to make technology a driving force in creating a better world.
