# Any Questions?

## What is the Robin Hood Army?

The Robin Hood Army is a zero-funds volunteer organization that works to get surplus food from restaurants and communities to serve the less fortunate.

Our ‚ÄúRobins‚Äù are largely students and young working professionals ‚Äì everyone does this in their free time. The lesser fortunate sections of society we serve include homeless families, orphanages, patients from public hospitals and old age homes.

## How did this start?

Modeled on the Re-Food program in Portugal, the Robin Hood Army started on the streets of Delhi, India in August 2014.

## So where are you now?
At last count, we have served 139 million people across 406 cities in 13 countries. Still 1% Done.

## What about funds?
We have just one rule ‚Äì we are a zero funds organization. The Robin Hood Army has no revenue, employees, nor office space ‚Äì if you want to help, all we need is your time. By the way, our balance sheet from last year:

## Wait, I don't get it. How do you grow without money?
Simple ‚Äì we are in the business of spreading smiles. We share our experiences on social media. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are our tools to grow. Along the way, our extremely passionate Robins and kind members of the press community have helped drive our mission to the world.

## I like this-how can I help?
Easy ‚Äì we need just 3 hours of your week on a regular basis. You can join our team of Robins or contribute food in your city ‚Äì you‚Äôll find everything you need to know

## Do you provide certificate to volunteers?
Naa ‚Äì we want our team to serve less fortunate people, not build their own polished resumes üôÇ . Citizens First ‚Üí Mission Next ‚Üí Robins Last.

## How can I donate?
Thanks for wanting to support us ‚Äì the Robin Hood Army DOES NOT accept money. We have grown through contributions in kind and partnerships.

## Wait, so do you have any rules?
Three specifically ‚Äì we do not collect money, we are a-political, and we serve all religions. If anyone claims to being those using the name of RHA, please drop us a note here.

Also irritating legal disclaimer: RHA is a zero funds platform with no employees, office space, and insurance hence cannot assume liability. Any personal risk is borne by our Robins individually.

## I'm with the press and want to know more! How do I get in touch?
Thanks for the interest ‚Äì hopefully this will help us spread our reach to more Robins, more cities, and more people. Do write to us at info@robinhoodarmy.com.
