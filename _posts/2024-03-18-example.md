### Highlights

- Set up a link for our modified version of the Robin Hood Army website using Azure for further SEO testing purposes
- Created Peer Evaluations survey using Microsoft Forms and published link on website along with team project link
- Working on updating the keywords on all pages of the Robin Hood Army website (and also adding additional ones suggested by the partner)
- Trying to minify the Javascript in the Robin Hood Army website

### Challenges

- Trying to add cache expiration (mod_expires) and deflate for compression (mod_deflate) but it does not seem to be working and no errors are being raised
- Trying to find and use alternative tools like SEOQuake to get further insight on SEO improvements to make, since we do not want to have to verify the ownership of the site
  
### Next Steps

- Update the target size for clicking on the mobile version of the site (a larger surface area will help avoid misclicks and thus, improve SEO)
- Finish up the existing SEO improvement changes planned
- Begin to tackle the next project deliverable: Demo
- Meet with the partner to discuss insights from the Google Analytics of the original website to determine further areas of improvement
