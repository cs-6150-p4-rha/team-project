## The Problem

The challenge is not a lack of food - it is making food consistently available to everyone who needs it.

## The Idea

### Who Are We?

The Robin Hood Army is a volunteer based, zero-funds organization that works to get surplus food from restaurants and the community to serve less fortunate people. Our local chapters are run by friends and colleagues, who hope to create a difference in their own unique way. For example, restaurants in the neighbourhood Green Park, will contribute to the homeless of the locality, through volunteers who live in Green Park. Our “Robins” are largely students and young working professionals – everyone does this in their free time. The lesser fortunate sections of society we serve include homeless families, orphanages, patients from public hospitals, and old age homes.

### Our vision

Simple really, beat global hunger and bring out the best of humanity using food as a medium.The idea is to create self-sustained chapters across the world who will look after their local community. And in the process, inspire people around us to give back to those who need it most.

## Our Journey

On the army’s first night of distribution, we realized that helping the less fortunate may feel good personally, but feeding 50 odd people at night, once a week would not create any real difference in a country where millions are starving.

Hunger is an acute problem. We needed to reach out to more people, more restaurants, and more cities - our deadline being yesterday.

### 2014-15

The RHA expands its base across international borders, and sets up the Robin Hood Academy — a feeder program where Robins teach and enable hundreds of street children to pursue primary education through a structured curriculum.

### 2017

### 2018

- 103 Cities

The RHA embraces tech and data to scale its presence across urban and rural areas. RHA gets featured as a Harvard case study; the zero funds systems which motivates civic society to serve the masses, is taught as a new model for the business, academic and philanthropic world.

### 2019

- 28,164,165 served
- 159 cities

With over 28 million people served — the army streamlines its processes to set up hyperlocal community chapters across the world. Our focus is to become a global engine which brings out the best of humanity using food as a medium.

## How You Can Help

    - All we need is 3 hours/week at least twice a month to make a real impact. If we have a team in your city looking to grow, a Robin will reach out to you.

- Contribute Food
    - If you manage a restaurant or generally want to contribute regular meals from your family or workplace, let’s connect.

- Teach
    - Creating access to education is the purest form of nation building – do you want to teach our kids in the Robin Hood Academy?
