title: Robin Hood Army
---

## Project Description

Robin Hood Army is an organization that distributes surplus food to those less fortunate. It has local communities called 'chapters' in countless cities in the world wherein volunteers work to serve food to homeless families, orphanages etc. Robin Hood Army aims to optimize their website for search engines. Specifically, they seek to prioritize relevant local chapters, ensuring their website appears prominently at the top of search results when users conduct searches on Google looking to start a new one in their locality.

## Project Goal

The biggest goal of this project is to improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of the Robin Hood Army website, such that when users and members of the organization want to start a new chapter of the Robin Hood Army in another region, city, or country, they are able to do so by searching the relevant terms and coming across the Robin Hood Army website as one of the top ranking entries in their search.

We aim to ensure that the Robin Hood Army website shows up in the top rankings of Google when appropriate terms are searched, therefore helping the organization to broaden their reach and establish themselves in even more countries. This goal can be broken down as follows:
- Analyze the RHA website to gain an understanding of what SEO improvements could be made and develop a strategy for how they can be added to the pre-existing website
- Implement the changes onto a copy of the codebase, deploying locally to test the level of improvement made to SEO
- Evaluate the impact of the changes made by conducting studies and present a report to the partner detailing any updates, progress, analysis on a bi/tri-weekly basis, before migrating the code to the original website’s codebase near the end of the semester
  
Once this goal is fulfilled, we also hope to implement further improvements to the website regarding performance, accessibility and overall usability.
