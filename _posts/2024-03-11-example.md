### Highlights So Far

#### Improving SEO of RHA Site

- Added Apache httpd.conf and Docker files to facilitate setting up and running the website locally
- Updated `<img>` tags by adding an `alt` attribute to improve SEO Lighthouse score
- Added keywords related to target audience on project homepage to ensure website will appear for additional relevant search terms
- Converted images on project homepage from .jpg and .png to next-gen .webp format to decrease image load times

#### Assignment Deliverables

- Created a team webpage with project description, goals and team members listed, ensuring maximum Lighthouse scores
- Created an engaging presentation relaying the project goals and architecture details to both mentor and partner
- Created an accompanying video for the presentation
- Devised two tasks and two questions for each task that helped in the assessment of our initial prototype of the Robin Hood Army website, and evaluated whether the changes implemented had a positive impact on the website's SEO

### Challenges

- Setting up a link for our modified version of the Robin Hood Army website instead of it only being accessible locally using Docker (we found that a cloud hosting platform such as Azure or Vercel would be needed to deploy the Apache app so we are looking into possible avenues of deployment that are free to use)

### Next Steps

- Make our modified version of the Robin Hood Army website available at a link (for Peer Evaluations as well as further SEO testing purposes)
- Use SEO tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to help pinpoint aspects of the site that need to be focused on for SEO improvement and implement the necessary changes
- Add more relevant keywords, taking initial evaluation feedback into consideration (and update changes to all pages of the website)
- Convert images on all pages of the website to .webp format
